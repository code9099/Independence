# Update connection string in server.js if needed
```

#### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication if not already enabled

#### Step 2: Generate App Password
1. Go to Google Account > Security > 2-Step Verification
2. Click "App passwords" at the bottom
3. Generate password for "Mail"
4. Copy the 16-character password

#### Step 3: Set Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your project root:

EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_16_character_app_password
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587

```

#### Step 4: Update Officer Database
Edit `services/departmentMapper.js` with real officer emails:

```javascript
const OFFICER_DATABASE = {
  "DJB": {
    "New Delhi": {
      name: "Real Officer Name",
      designation: "Assistant Engineer",
      email: "real.officer@delhi.gov.in", // UPDATE THIS
      phone: "+91-11-23456789",
      zone: "Zone-1 Central Delhi"
    }
  }
  // ... add more real officers
};
```

### 3. Start the Application

#### Backend:
```bash
node server.js
```

#### Frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test Email Functionality

1. Submit a test complaint via `/report`
2. Check console logs for email status
3. Verify email delivery to officer

### 5. Department Mapping

The system automatically maps:
- **Water issues** â†’ DJB (Delhi Jal Board)
- **Road/Traffic** â†’ PWD (Public Works Department)  
- **Garbage/Sanitation** â†’ MCD (Municipal Corporation of Delhi)
- **Others** â†’ MCD (default)

### 6. Complaint Flow

1. User submits complaint â†’ `/api/issues`
2. System determines department via AI mapping
3. Looks up assigned officer for area + department
4. Sends professional email to officer
5. Logs email status in MongoDB
6. Updates complaint timeline
7. User can track via "My Complaints"
